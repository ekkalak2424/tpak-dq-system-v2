# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TPAK DQ System is a WordPress plugin designed to manage data quality for survey systems. It connects to LimeSurvey API and manages a 3-step verification process with 4 user roles. The system provides automated data import, workflow management, notifications, and comprehensive validation features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: LimeSurvey API Integration

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to connect to LimeSurvey RemoteControl 2 API so that I can automatically import survey data into the WordPress system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN administrator configures LimeSurvey API settings THEN system SHALL validate URL, username, password, and survey ID
2. WHEN system connects to LimeSurvey API THEN system SHALL retrieve survey data automatically
3. WHEN importing survey data THEN system SHALL prevent duplicate data imports
4. IF API connection fails THEN system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN survey data is retrieved THEN system SHALL validate data structure before import

### Requirement 2: User Role Management System

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage 4 different user roles with specific permissions so that I can control access to different parts of the verification workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system is activated THEN system SHALL create 4 user roles: Administrator, Interviewer (A), Supervisor (B), and Examiner (C)
2. WHEN Administrator role is assigned THEN user SHALL have access to all system settings and management functions
3. WHEN Interviewer (A) role is assigned THEN user SHALL only access data with "pending_a" or "rejected_by_b" status
4. WHEN Supervisor (B) role is assigned THEN user SHALL only access data with "pending_b" status
5. WHEN Examiner (C) role is assigned THEN user SHALL only access data with "pending_c" status
6. WHEN user attempts unauthorized access THEN system SHALL deny access and display appropriate message

### Requirement 3: Three-Step Verification Workflow

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to follow a structured 3-step verification process so that data quality is maintained through proper review stages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new data is imported THEN system SHALL set status to "pending_a"
2. WHEN Interviewer (A) completes review THEN system SHALL change status to "pending_b"
3. WHEN Supervisor (B) approves data THEN system SHALL apply sampling gate (70% finalized, 30% to pending_c)
4. WHEN Supervisor (B) rejects data THEN system SHALL change status to "rejected_by_b"
5. WHEN Examiner (C) approves data THEN system SHALL change status to "finalized"
6. WHEN Examiner (C) rejects data THEN system SHALL change status to "rejected_by_c"
7. WHEN data reaches sampling gate THEN system SHALL randomly assign 70% to "finalized_by_sampling" and 30% to "pending_c"

### Requirement 4: Dashboard and Data Display

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to view statistics and data filtered by my role permissions so that I can efficiently manage my assigned tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user accesses dashboard THEN system SHALL display statistics based on user role permissions
2. WHEN displaying data lists THEN system SHALL filter data according to user role and status
3. WHEN user views data details THEN system SHALL show audit trail history
4. WHEN Administrator accesses dashboard THEN system SHALL display comprehensive statistics for all data
5. IF user has no assigned data THEN system SHALL display appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 5: Email Notification System

**User Story:** As a system user, I want to receive email notifications when new tasks are assigned or status changes occur so that I can respond promptly to workflow updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data status changes to user's responsibility THEN system SHALL send email notification to assigned user
2. WHEN Administrator enables email notifications THEN system SHALL activate notification sending
3. WHEN Administrator disables email notifications THEN system SHALL stop sending notifications
4. WHEN email sending fails THEN system SHALL log error for administrator review
5. WHEN notification is sent THEN system SHALL include relevant data details and action links

### Requirement 6: Automated Data Import with Cron Jobs

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to schedule automatic data imports from LimeSurvey so that new survey responses are regularly synchronized without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Administrator sets import interval THEN system SHALL schedule cron job accordingly (hourly, twice daily, daily, weekly)
2. WHEN cron job executes THEN system SHALL connect to LimeSurvey API and import new data
3. WHEN importing data THEN system SHALL prevent duplicate imports by checking existing records
4. IF cron job fails THEN system SHALL log error details for administrator review
5. WHEN manual import is triggered THEN system SHALL execute immediate data import

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Data Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive data validation throughout the system so that data integrity is maintained and security is ensured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API settings are saved THEN system SHALL validate URL format, credentials, and survey ID
2. WHEN survey data is imported THEN system SHALL validate data structure and format
3. WHEN user performs workflow actions THEN system SHALL validate user permissions and data state
4. WHEN meta box data is saved THEN system SHALL validate JSON format and data size limits
5. WHEN user input is processed THEN system SHALL validate length, format, and security
6. IF validation fails THEN system SHALL display specific error messages and prevent data corruption

### Requirement 8: Settings and Configuration Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure system settings including API connections, cron schedules, and notification preferences so that the system operates according to organizational requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing settings page THEN system SHALL display all configuration options organized by category
2. WHEN saving LimeSurvey settings THEN system SHALL test API connection and validate survey ID
3. WHEN configuring cron settings THEN system SHALL validate interval options and survey ID
4. WHEN setting sampling percentage THEN system SHALL validate range (1-100)
5. WHEN enabling/disabling notifications THEN system SHALL update notification status immediately

### Requirement 9: Data Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust security measures and access controls so that sensitive survey data is protected and only authorized users can perform specific actions.
